Inline partials should get squashed down: One  TwoThree.

The same partial on its own line shouldn't get squashed down:
One
  Two
Three
(and shouldn't add any new lines before or after).

Partials should be indented on the level that they're included:
  One
    Two
  Three
(still no newlines).

These should all be single lines; too hard to do it otherwise.
This is more consistent too.
