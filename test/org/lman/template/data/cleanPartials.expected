Inline partials should get squashed down: One  TwoThree.

The same partial on its own line shouldn't get squashed down:
One
  Two
Three
(and shouldn't add any new lines before or after).

More funkiness when they're adjacent:
One
  Two
Three
One

(woo).

Partials should be indented on the level that they're included:
  One
    Two
  Three
(still no newlines).

Even more funk:
  One
    Two
  Three
    One
      Two
    Three
  One

    One
      Two
    Three
(woo).

These single-line sections should still render as blocks.
