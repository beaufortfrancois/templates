This tests partials that are passed an incomplete set of arguments bound to
local variables.

Rendering in outer context:
-> bound to the same name
I am rendering partial (a=outer a, b=outer b) now.
-> bound to swapped names
I am rendering partial (a=outer b, b=outer a) now.

Rendering in inner context with pre-bound variables:
-> bound to the same name
I am rendering partial (a=inner a, b=inner b) now.
-> bound to swapped names
I am rendering partial (a=inner b, b=inner a) now.

Rendering in inner context with post-bound variables:
-> bound to the same name
(a=inner a, b=inner b)
-> bound to swapped names
(a=inner b, b=inner a)

Done.
